Alright, I’m putting on my “principal backend curmudgeon” hat. Brutal and useful.

# Brutal take

A generic “expense tracker” screams toy. Every recruiter has seen 50. If you ship yet another CRUD with charts, it reads: *“built a tutorial.”* Useless.

You make it resume-worthy by doing **two** things:

1. Solve a **hard systems problem** cleanly (sync, offline, correctness at scale, reliability).
2. Ship it like a **small real product** (packaging, benchmarks, docs, ops, tests).

# What gets you hired (for this project)

* **Local-first core with trustworthy sync.** Offline SQLite that later merges via conflict-free rules. No data loss. Deterministic results.
* **Fast ingest at the edge.** Parse SMS/email receipts, OCR images, VIN decode, fuel price APIs (mockable), and do it **fast**.
* **Sharp domain math done right.** Cost per km/mi, TCO, depreciation models, tax categories—reproducible, unit-tested.
* **Ops story.** Migrations, observability, error budgets, SLOs, structured logs, rate limiting, and a real deployment method.
* **Benchmarks against a baseline.** “1000 receipts ingested in 1.2s on M2; P95 < 25ms queries.” Numbers beat adjectives.

# Scope that actually differentiates (pick 3–4 and nail them)

* **Local-first with CRDT/OT merge** (no server required; optional sync via your storage).
* **Ultra-fast entry**: 2 taps for fuel fill-up (state machine, smart defaults from last odometer + tank size).
* **Receipt pipeline**: mailbox/SMS watcher → parser plugins → normalization → idempotent store (dedupe by hash).
* **Tax-ready exports (Canada)**: CRA-friendly CSV, split personal vs business mileage properly.
* **What-if forecasting**: project next 12 months cost with uncertainty bands.

# Non-features (to keep it sharp)

* No multi-tenant SaaS, no social, no budgets widget soup.
* No bloated UI: one mobile-friendly screen + CLI/TUI.
* No push notifications circus. Keep focus.

# Architecture (hire-me version)

**Local**

* `core/` (pure domain): entries, vehicles, policies, currency/units lib, tax rules.
* `store/`: SQLite (WAL), deterministic schema migrations.
* `sync/`: log-structured CRDT (last-writer-wins per field + vector clocks); export/import over encrypted file in your drive.
* `ingest/`: sources (image OCR, email, SMS), parsers (regex + ML-lite), dedupe.
* `api/`: REST + gRPC (for fun), auth = local passkey or nothing (local-first).
* `ui/`: minimal web/PWA or TUI (ratatui/bubbletea).

**Server (optional add-on for sync & remote backups)**

* stateless API → object store for blobs → Postgres for indexes → job queue for OCR.
* all endpoints idempotent; E2E encryption an option so server can be dumb.

**Data model (SQLite)**

```
vehicles(id pk, vin unique, nickname, tank_litres, odometer_unit, created_at)
entries(id pk, vehicle_id fk, at_ts, kind enum('fuel','service','toll','parking','insurance','tax'),
        qty, unit, amount_cents, currency, odometer, note, source_hash unique, created_at)
receipts(id pk, entry_id fk, blob_sha256, mime, bytes, ocr_text, created_at)
sync_clock(entity, entity_id, vclock_json, updated_at)
```

* `source_hash` ensures ingest idempotency.
* All money as integer cents. Units explicit. Timezone explicit.

**APIs (examples)**

* `POST /v1/vehicles`
* `POST /v1/entries` (idempotency-key header)
* `GET /v1/analytics/cost-per-km?vehicle_id=...&from=...&to=...`
* `POST /v1/sync/push` / `POST /v1/sync/pull` (change sets with vector clocks)

**Ingest pipeline**

* Watcher → Normalizer → Parser chain (regex, line heuristics, merchant profiles) → Validator (units, currency) → Idempotent write.
* Pluggable parser interfaces; golden test fixtures for each merchant.

**Observability**

* Structured logs (Zap/Logrus).
* Prometheus metrics: ingest\_latency\_ms, parser\_accuracy, db\_p95\_ms, sync\_conflicts\_count.
* Traces around OCR and DB writes.

**Testing**

* Property-based tests for currency/units math.
* Golden tests for receipt parsing (input image/email ↔ normalized entry).
* Fuzz: parsers, sync merge.
* Load test: 100k entries; verify P95 queries < 30ms; DB file size growth bound.

**Performance targets**

* CLI add-entry < 150ms end-to-end.
* Cold start < 400ms.
* 50k entries DB VACUUM < 10s; full text search P95 < 50ms.

**Security**

* Local encryption at rest (SQLCipher) optional.
* E2E for sync bundles (age/NaCl).
* Threat model doc in `/docs/security.md`.

# How it should read on your résumé (tight, measurable)

**Auto Expense Tracker — Local-first, Privacy-Preserving (Go + SQLite + CRDT)**

* Built a **local-first expense engine** (Go, SQLite/WAL) with **conflict-free sync** via vector clocks, ensuring deterministic merges and **zero data loss** across devices.
* Designed an **idempotent ingest pipeline** (email/SMS/OCR) with pluggable parsers; achieved **99.2% deduping accuracy** across 10k+ real-world receipts.
* Implemented **domain-correct analytics** (cost/km, TCO, depreciation) with property-based tests; P95 query latency **< 25ms** on 50k-entry dataset.
* Added **observability** (Prometheus, structured logs) and regression load tests; sustained **5k entries/sec ingest** on M2, **<1.5s** cold import of 1000 receipts.
* Shipped **PWA + CLI** with one-file export/import and **E2E-encrypted sync bundles**; documented threat model and backup/restore procedures.

(If you skip the server, remove what’s not applicable. Replace numbers with your real benchmarks.)

# Demo script (what I’d expect in your GIF/video)

1. Add a vehicle → set tank size.
2. Drag-drop an email `.eml` and a gas-station photo → both parsed → one deduped.
3. Instantly show updated cost/km chart; click point → jump to receipt & OCR text.
4. Turn off Wi-Fi → add entries; turn on Wi-Fi → run `sync push/pull`; show conflict resolution log.
5. Export CRA-friendly CSV.
6. `time ./import 1000_receipts/` → print ingest rate & P95.

# Pitfalls that scream “student project”

* Hand-wavy sync (“last write wins lol”) without clocks or audit.
* Floating-point money.
* No migrations; schema churn breaks old data.
* No idempotency; duplicate entries on retries.
* Benchmarks with adjectives, not numbers.
* 20 dependencies for a CSV import you could write in 30 lines.

# 2–3 week plan (aggressive but doable)

**Week 1:** core domain, schema, migrations, CLI add/list, cost/km calc, unit tests.
**Week 2:** ingest pipeline (email + 1 photo parser), idempotency, analytics API, PWA/TUI MVP, docs.
**Week 3:** sync bundles + vector clocks, basic conflict tests, perf run on 50k synthetic entries, Prom metrics, README benchmarks + demo.

Ship **small, fast, correct**. If you deliver the above, the project will read as: *“This person understands systems, correctness, and product polish.”* That gets interviews.

If you want, I can draft the repo skeleton (dirs, Go module, migrations, a working CLI add/list, and a golden test for a sample receipt) so you start from a solid spine.
